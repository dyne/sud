<h1 id="sud--super-user-do">SUD :: Super User Do</h1>
<p>This software aims to be a UNIX tool for generic secure usage when in need of privilege escalation. It is designed to run SUID, with &quot;super-user powers&quot; to execute things as root on the system it is installed.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>SUD is designed for security: it leverages all possible measures to avoid vulnerabilities, primarily the reduction of complexity in its own design and implementation.</p>
<p>SUD is software written following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate-programming</a> approach and welcomes reviews and contributions, also anonymous ones.</p>
<p>You are welcome to read <a href="https://sud.dyne.org/sud.html">SUD's source-code and documentation</a>.</p>
<p>SUD is licensed as Public Domain in the hope to improve the security of UNIX systems at large. The portability of <code>sud</code> to any BSD and POSIX compliant system is a desirable feature and contributions are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>
<p>SUD is distributed as a static binary for various platforms on <a href="https://files.dyne.org/sud">files.dyne.org/sud</a></p>
<p>Binaries include <a href="https://musl-libc.org">musl-libc</a> as a statically linked component.</p>
<p>To start using sud on a 64bit GNU+Linux machine, simply do:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://files.dyne.org/sud/sud_x86_64 &gt; ~/Downloads/sud
sudo install -o root -g root -p -m 4775 sud /usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>vigr</code> or edit <code>/etc/groups</code> to make sure your privileged users are in the <code>sudo</code> or <code>wheel</code> groups.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>This software is a direct response to the <code>sudo</code> tool which has been adopted by major Linux and BSD distros while augmenting its complexity and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=sudo">collecting vulnerabilities</a> last not least <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156">CVE-2021-3156</a>.</p>
<p>With SUD we intend to finally act up and develop something different, considering we have been relying for 10 years on something that could have been trivially hacked all that time.</p>
<p>SUD takes inspiration from the suckless tool <a href="https://sup.dyne.org">sup</a> and welcomes contributions from coders who are well incline to be suckless.</p>
<p>SUD will never, ever include integrations with systemd.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-sud-from-source">How to build SUD from source</h2>
<p>Literate programming source-code starts from documentation which is then used to generate the source-code and a website. In case of SUD we use the <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">Literate Programming System</a> written in D, which is included as a submodule in the <code>literate</code> sub-folder. Also <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> is needed to render the README into its homepage. To make sure it is ready for use:</p>
<ol>
<li>install <code>dub</code> the D package registry</li>
<li>install <code>pandoc</code> for markdown rendering</li>
<li>make sure the <code>literate</code> git submodule is initialised and updated</li>
<li>type <code>make</code></li>
</ol>
<p>All the above should be possible on any operating system, if you don't know why is most likely because you don't know well enough the system you are running. Go find out.</p>
